              Customer data including sales, ad exposure, product purchases and

              A predictive analytics model of customer Lifetime Value will
              leverage Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to store, analyze and

              The accuracy and actionability of predicted customer value models
              depends on availability of 1st party data. A common solution
              focuses on the use of BigQueryML as it provides a powerful

            <p>
              Identifying the factors that lead to a conversion by a customer is
              the core of marketing attribution. These models can be rule based
              in nature but this leaves gaps in the understanding of impact from
              each of these touchpoints.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unearthing the touchpoints through algorithmic means allows for a
              data-driven approach to attribution and audience segmentation.
              Interactions with ads and conversions all become factors in how
              these data-driven audiences are formed, allowing for optimized
              media activations.

              Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses,
              occurring when a customer stops buying products or services. By
              using an ML model that assigns a propensity score to each
              customer, businesses can allocate resources more effectively. This
              allows them to identify low-intent users, invest in acquiring new
              customers, and re-market to undecided customers.

              Google Cloud offers tools to gather and combine online data with
              1st party data, analyze it, visualize it, and ultimately use it to
              make informed decisions. By introducing ML models to address
              churn, businesses can reduce revenue loss and alleviate negative
              pressure on ROI.

              Identifying a customer's buying stage is crucial for brands to
              deploy effective marketing strategies that drive conversions. By
              establishing a purchase propensity score at the customer level,
              brands gain valuable predictive power in making marketing
              decisions.

              An omni-channel measurement strategy involves tracking and
              analyzing customer interactions across multiple channels including
              websites, social media, email, and mobile apps. The goal is to
              gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and
              preferences, and use this information to optimize marketing
              efforts and improve customer experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              This strategy should include key performance indicators (KPIs)
              specific to each channel, as well as a unified dashboard that
              brings together all data for a holistic view of the customer
              journey. Regular analysis and iteration based on data-driven

              Our approach to building advanced attribution models involves
              activating behavioral data and analyzing key user actions that
              impact conversion rates. In addition to standard data on user
              interactions with advertising systems, we incorporate behavioral
              data from the site to gain a more comprehensive view of user
              behavior.
            </p>

              By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we are able to identify
              the paths of users that lead to the highest conversion rates and
              determine how these paths influence overall conversion rates.
              Ultimately, this approach enables us to optimize marketing efforts

              In order to measure the impact of each channel on a customer's

        <h2>MIGRATION TO SERVER-SIDE TRACKING</h2>
        <section class="services__sectionblock-position">
          <div class="services__sectionblock-text">
            <p>
              Migration to server-side tracking refers to the process of moving
              from client-side tracking to server-side tracking, where data is
              collected and processed on the server-side rather than the
              client-side. This migration offers several benefits including
              increased data privacy and security, improved data accuracy and
              completeness, and reduced reliance on third-party cookies.
            </p>

              <p>
                Increased data privacy and security: With server-side tracking,
                data is collected and processed on the server-side, which helps
                to protect user privacy and ensure compliance with data privacy
                regulations.

              <p>
                Improved data accuracy and completeness: Server-side tracking
                can help to ensure that data is collected and processed
                accurately and completely, reducing the likelihood of data loss
                or discrepancies.

              <p>
                Reduced reliance on third-party cookies: As many browsers are
                moving away from third-party cookies, server-side tracking
                provides an alternative solution for collecting and processing
                user data.

                Flexibility and customization: Server-side tracking offers
                greater flexibility and customization options, enabling
                businesses to tailor their tracking and data processing to their
                specific needs.

                can help to reduce the amount of code running on the
                client-side, which can help to improve site performance and

          <div class="services__sectionblock-text">
            <p>
              Data layer development refers to the process of designing and
              implementing the layer of an application that is responsible for
              managing and manipulating data.
            </p>
            <p>
              This layer is often referred to as the data access layer or the
              data persistence layer, and it is an essential component of any
              application that requires the storage and retrieval of
              data.Overall, the development of a data layer is a critical part
              of building a robust and reliable application. It requires careful
              planning, design, and implementation to ensure that data is stored
              and retrieved accurately and efficiently.

              <p>
                Improved data accuracy and consistency by creating a centralized
                data layer, businesses can ensure that data is consistent and
                accurate across all parts of the application. This can help to
                reduce errors, improve decision-making, and increase customer
                satisfaction.

                Faster time-to-market for new features: A well-designed data
                layer can help developers to quickly and easily add new features
                to an application. By separating the data layer from the rest of
                the application, developers can work on the data layer
                independently, allowing them to make changes and improvements
                without impacting other parts of the application.

                Better scalability and performance: A well-designed data layer
                can help businesses to scale their applications as needed. By
                optimizing data storage and retrieval, businesses can improve
                application performance, reduce downtime, and provide a better
                user experience.

              As the amount of data continues to grow in complex digital
              ecosystems, breaking down data silos can increase the value of
              marketing efforts. Cloud automation can be established through
              incremental improvements, translating manual processes into
              automated ones. Organizations should focus on automating
              repetitive, time-intensive tasks with relatively low value, rather
              than aiming for complete automation.
            </p>
            <p>
              A wide range of automation tasks, including campaign management,
              API reporting, bulk actions, inventory and budget management, and
              bid automation, can be valuable to a marketing ecosystem. By
              defining a roadmap aligned with business objectives, organizations
              can gradually increase their use of cloud technologies to achieve
              marketing goals and improve the value of their data over time.
